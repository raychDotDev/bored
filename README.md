The game is simple

You are the little ball, and you need to survive as long as you can against two bigger balls

CONTROLS:

    [A\D] - move left\right
    [SPACE] - jump\double jump
    [LEFT SHIFT] + [A\D] - dash left\right (you have 3 dashes in air that will recharge after landing)
    [S] - stomp

The "evil balls" can use dash as well, if they turned full red - they will dash to you if you are too far.

Have fun! 

I hope that i will update this game, so, stay tuned <3<br/>
